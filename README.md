## Project Structure

```
expressBookReview/
├── index.js                   # Express app entry point
├── general.js                 # Task 10 – Async/Await & Promises with Axios
├── package.json
└── router/
    ├── booksdb.js             # Book data store
    ├── auth_users.js          # In-memory users store
    ├── general.js             # Public routes (Tasks 1-6)
    └── auth_users_routes.js   # Authenticated routes (Tasks 7-9)
```

## Notes
- JWT tokens are stored in `express-session` so cookie-based `curl -c / -b` works.
- Each user can only modify or delete **their own** reviews.
- `general.js` (root level) uses Async/Await for Task 1 and Promises for Tasks 2–4.
